Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.
A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
And know that I am with you always; yes, to the end of time.
So I say to you, Ask and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day's own trouble be sufficient for the day.
I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.
Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to cast a stone.
Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.
